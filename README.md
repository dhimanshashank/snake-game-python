# snake-game-python

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game allows the player to control a snake, guiding it to eat food to increase its length while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game window.

## Features

- Control the snake using arrow keys or WASD keys.
- Score increases upon eating food.
- Snake length increases with each food item eaten.
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the boundary.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Turtle graphics library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- No additional libraries are required as Turtle is included in the standard Python library.

## Usage

1. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

2. Control the snake using the arrow keys or WASD keys.
3. Eat food items to increase your score and snake length.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the game window boundary.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundary.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspiration for this project came from classic Snake games.
- Special thanks to the Turtle graphics library for making graphical programming in Python fun and accessible.
